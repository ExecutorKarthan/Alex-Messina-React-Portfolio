                    Hello! My name is Alex Messina and I am an inquisitive, life-long learner that enjoys exploring challenges.
                    I am a firm believer in honest self-reflection as a path to improvement and view criticism as an opportunity to engage in that 
                    self-reflection. I think that collaboration is the ideal tool to produce the best quality product as it allows for a larger body 
                    of knowledge and unique perspectives to be applied to the problem in question. 
                    I tend to spend my free time programming to help someone make a repetitive, tedious task doable faster. At the moment, I do not have much 
                    free time as I am currently working toward completing my Web Developer Boot Camp through Washington University - St. Louis. I have leveraged 
                    what I am learning to produce the projects that you see below, as well as more you can find on my GithHub page.
